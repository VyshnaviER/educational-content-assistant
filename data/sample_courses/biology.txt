Introduction to Biology

Biology is the scientific study of life and living organisms.

Key Concepts:
1. Cells: The basic unit of life
2. DNA: Carries genetic information
3. Evolution: Explains diversity of life
4. Homeostasis: Maintains internal balance

Photosynthesis:
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy (glucose).
Equation: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light → C6H12O6 + 6O2

Cellular Respiration:
Cellular respiration converts nutrients into energy (ATP).
Equation: C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O + energy

Study Tips:
- Review concepts daily
- Create diagrams for processes
- Practice with flashcards
