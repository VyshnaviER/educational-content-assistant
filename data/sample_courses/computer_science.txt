Computer Science Basics

Programming Fundamentals:

Variables: Containers for storing data values.
Example: x = 5, name = "John"

Functions: Reusable blocks of code.
Example: def greet(name): return "Hello " + name

Loops: Repeat actions multiple times.
Example: for i in range(5): print(i)

Conditionals: Make decisions in code.
Example: if x > 0: print("Positive")

Data Structures:
- Arrays/Lists: Ordered collections
- Dictionaries: Key-value pairs
- Sets: Unique elements

Algorithms:
Step-by-step procedures for solving problems.
Examples: Sorting, Searching, Pathfinding
